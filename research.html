			<p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.2em; color: #333;">
			My research interests lie in the general area of stars and
			stellar systems, especially as tracers for how galaxies
			formed (including our home, the Milky Way) evolved over the
			last 13 billion years. In parallel, I have a long-standing
			interest in advancing new technology (both hardware and
			software) to open new astronomical discovery space windows.
			</p>

			<p>
			The intersection of my scientific and technical interests is
			reflected in my strong publication record in the technical
			literature (especially SPIE proceedings â€“ the international
			society of optic engineers) as well as high-impact astronomy
			and astrophysics journals. 
			</p>

			<p> My current interest is the application of modern data
			science approaches (including machine learning approaches
			related to computer vision and topological data analysis)
			for exploration and discovery in large public datasets with
			information on millions to billions of astronomical objects.
			Mathematically, this is akin to illuminating and exploiting
			structure in n-dimensional point clouds. This is a new area
			for me. I am working on developing the expertise needed to
			work on real (as opposed to toy) research questions. To that
			end, I am building collaborations with AI/ML experts at
			UTSA. </b>

			<p>Much of my expertise development work uses data from the ESA Gaia
			mission. Later, I hope to explore data from the
			Large Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the Dark Energy
			Survey (DES), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
			(DESI) &mdash;  all experiments I helped to advance while serving
			as director of the U.S. nighttime, ground-based national observatory.</p>
			
			<p>This focus area is an excellent framework for
			undergraduate experiential learning since skills learned
			have wide application beyond astronomy. </p>
