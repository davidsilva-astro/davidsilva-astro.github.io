					<p class="emphasis"> I am a Distinguished Professor of Physics and
					Astronomy at the University of Texas at San Antonio, an
					Affliate Faculty member of the UTSA School of Data Science, and 
					project leader for the UTSA space sector visioning effort.</p>

					<p>Previously, I was Dean of the UTSA College of Sciences (2019
					â€“ 2024) and Director of the National Optical Astronomy
					Observatory (NOAO), the NSF's national observatory for
					ground-based optical-infrared astronomy.</p>

					<p>NOAO developed, built, and operated astronomical telescopes,
					instruments, and data systems in Arizona and Chile. During his
					directorship, NOAO and its partners implemented the Community
					Science and Data Center (home of the Astro Data Lab), the U.S.
					Extremely Large Telescope Program, the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
					and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In 2020,
					NOAO assets were merged into the NSF's National Optical Infrared
					Laboratory, NOIRLab. David co-led the team that developed the
					baseline concept and implementation plan that was approved by
					NSF.</p>

					<p>I am a leader in the design, development, and operation of
					observatories, telescopes, focal-plane instruments, and data
					systems for the American, European, and South American
					astronomical research communities. I have served on various
					international governance and review boards as well as held
					positions in the American Astronomical Society and the
					International Astronomical Union.
